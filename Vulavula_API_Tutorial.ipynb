In multilingual communication, embedding models trained on diverse languages can map the meaning of text into a shared space, enabling cross-language searches. For instance, in a customer support system, a query in one language can retrieve relevant answers stored in different languages, ensuring  access to information. This makes embedding search an invaluable tool for applications like FAQs, where users can find accurate and contextually relevant information regardless of language barriers."
